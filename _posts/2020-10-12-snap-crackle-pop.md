why we buy the breakfast cereals/brands - othe breakfast foods we do

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And for many this means something quick before work, with most turning to trusted cereal brands to save the day.

The food industry is a thriving and continuously growing place with areas of the market overly saturated and constant introduction of new products, which begs the question, how do brands stand out in such a large crowd?

Breakfast and cereal companies are one of the most populated markets going, and so their marketing campaigns and initial branding have to be powerful enough to overshine its competitors.

Kellogg’s uses typography as just one of its tools to succeed. With large letters and bright colours, the Kellogg’s brand is the most trusted and easily identified brand within the market.

Kellogg’s uses a custom typeface for its logo, crafted in a script style mimicking handwriting, this is often seen in advertising of products aimed at children, like various cereal brands, because of the playful and fun connotations the font brings.
