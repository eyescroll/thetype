## Welcome to the type...

Typography is such a large part of our daily lives but the question is what makes our favourite brands and day-to-day products so appealing? 

This blog takes a look at the typography used in everyday life and culture, bringing in ideas on how the stylistic choices used are so effective. From examining the packaging on our breakfast cereals to the writing we ink on our skin, this blog hopes to give a more personal insight into the typefaces we see everywhere, that make up our lives.
